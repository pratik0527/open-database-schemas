# Open-Database-Schemas
Sometimes architecting the database of your app can be the most difficult part. You want a schema that won't need to be rewritten a million times, a solid starting foundation for your app that takes into account the kind of information you want to be storing.

## What databases are supported?

These are high-level schemas you will have to convert over to your chosen schema. It's not specific to a particular database scheme.

## What about schema-less NoSQL databases?

Deny it all you want, but even so-called schema-less NoSQL solutions like Firebase/MongoDB use some kind of schema (call it a structure). This is that.

## How can I contribute a schema?

Fork this repository, add in your chosen schema and that's it.

Remember your schema is a guide only, so don't create it from a perspective of a particular database. If a field is a numeric field you would say Integer, as an integer is a pretty standard and commonly shared field type for most popular databases.
